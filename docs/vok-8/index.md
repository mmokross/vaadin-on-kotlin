# Vaadin-on-Kotlin Guides for Vaadin 8

Vaadin 8 is stable and battle-proven framework. Start here if you need to be production-ready.
It's based on the GWT-based customized widget system.

## Getting started Guides

When you are not familiar with Vaadin-on-Kotlin (or VoK for short), start here:

## Building the UIs

- [Creating UIs](creating_ui.md) explains how to compose your UI out of visual components such as Buttons and TextFields
- [Creating Forms](forms.md) walks you through the forms - how to create UI for them and how to validate the data.
- [Navigating](navigating.md) allows you to create multiple pages and explains how to navigate between them
- [Using Grids](grids.md) shows best practices on how to display a lazy-loaded tabular list of data.
