# Contributing To Vaadin On Kotlin

Thank you so much for using Vaadin on Kotlin!

Vaadin on Kotlin is not "someone else's framework" - it's an idea that a simple
framework will make your work on your projects much more productive.
Over the years we have seen complex frameworks to cause horrible production issues;
it is time to put the complex frameworks to rest and move beyond.

Quoting [Gregor Riegler on simplicity](http://gregorriegler.com/2019/08/10/who-needs-lombok-anyhow.html):

> I don't want any magic in my code. It is the thing that makes behaviour non-transparent. It makes you fire up your debugger, because you don't actually understand what is going on behind the scenes. There should be no behind the scenes. Everything should be as explicit as possible, for economic reasons.

Simplicity is the highest value of Vaadin on Kotlin.

## Reporting an Issue

Vaadin On Kotlin uses [GitHub Issue Tracking](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-on-kotlin/issues)
to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found
a bug in Vaadin on Kotlin, this is the place to start. You'll need to create
a (free) GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them, or
to create pull requests.

## Contributing to the Documentation

Vaadin on Kotlin has two main sets of documentation: the guides, which help you learn
about Vaadin on Kotlin, and the API, which serves as a reference.

You can help improve the VoK guides by making them more coherent, consistent, or
readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing
typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest edge VoK.

To do so, make changes to the guides source files (located [here](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-on-kotlin/tree/master/docs)
on GitHub). Then open a pull request to apply your changes to the master branch.
