/**
 * Allows the coder to write any SQL he wishes. This provider must be simple enough to not to get in the way by smart (complex) Kotlin language features.
 * It should support any SQL select, but should allow for adding custom filters and orderings (since this is plugged into Grid after all).
 *
 * The provider is bound to a *holder class* which holds the values (any POJO). vok-orm is used to map the result set to the class. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * data class CustomerAddress(val customerName: String, val address: String)
 *
 * val provider = sqlDataProvider(CustomerAddress::class.java, """select c.name as customerName, a.street || ' ' || a.city as address
 *     from Customer c inner join Address a on c.address_id=a.id where 1=1 {{WHERE}} order by 1=1{{ORDER}} {{PAGING}}""", idMapper = { it })
 * ```
 *
 * (Note how select column names must correspond to field names in the `CustomerAddress` class)
 *
 * Now `sqlDataProvider` can hot-patch the `where` clause computed from Grid's filters into `{{WHERE}}` (as a simple string replacement),
 * and the `order by` and `offset`/`limit` into the `{{ORDER}}` and `{{PAGING}}`, as follows:
 *
 * * `{{WHERE}}` will be replaced by something like this: `"and name=:pqw5as and age>:p123a"` - note the auto-generated parameter
 *   names starting with `p`. If there are no filters, will be replaced by an empty string.
 * * `{{ORDER}}` will be replaced by `", customerName ASC, street ASC"` or by an empty string if there is no ordering requirement.
 * * `{{PAGING}}` will be replaced by `"offset 0 limit 100"` or by an empty string if there are no limitations.
 *
 * Note that the Grid will display fields present in the `CustomerAddress` holder class and will also auto-generate filters
 * for them, based on the type of the field.
 *
 * No bloody annotations! Work in progress. It is expected that a holder class is written for every select, tailored to show the outcome
 * of that particular select.
 *
 * @param clazz the type of the holder class which will hold the result
 * @param sql the select which can map into the holder class (that is, it selects columns whose names match the holder class fields). It should contain
 * `{{WHERE}}`, `{{ORDER}}` and `{{PAGING}}` strings which will be replaced by a simple substring replacement.
 * @param params the [sql] may be parametrized; this map holds all the parameters present in the sql itself.
 * @param idMapper returns the primary key which must be unique for every row returned. If the holder class is a data class and/or has proper equals/hashcode, the class itself may act as the key; in such case
 * just pass in identity here: `{ it }`
 * @param T the type of the holder class.
